## Project Description                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                        
This is the first step towards building a full web application: the AirBnB clonee                                                       
. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during tt                                                       
his project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database stoo                                                       
rage, API, front-end integration                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                        
Each task is linked and will help you to:                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                        
- put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initializatt                                                       
ion, serialization and deserialization of your future instances                                                                         
- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionaryy                                                       
 <-> JSON string <-> file                                                                                                               
- create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place) that inherit froo                                                       
m BaseModel                                                                                                                             
- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.                                                              
- create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
